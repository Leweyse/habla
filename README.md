# HABLA
"Habla" is a web application that aims to be a study tool that adapts to any personality.

## DEMO
First Version: (15 January, 2021)

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
* JavaScript
* HTML
* Handlebars
* CSS
* Sass
* Git Bash
* MongoDB

## SPECIAL GOTCHAS OF MY PROJECT
### Problems I faced
My goal with this app prompted me to work with technologies and frameworks like Express.js, Sass, MongoDB, and Handlebars. Working on every detail of the design on the Front End and Back End helped me learn new things and remember what I already knew.

* This was my first time working with Sass. At some point in the project, each new idea came with the anguish of having to deal with my CSS file. I felt like writing CSS code became a headache, that's when I looked for a solution and found Sass. I hope to make the most of Sass's potential in this and my next projects, until then I will continue to learn more about this useful tool.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
